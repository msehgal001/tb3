AEROSPACE TESTING SAAS PLATFORM: TestBedz

TestBedz is a comprehensive, turn-key web application designed to connect clients with aerospace testing facilities. It functions as a SaaS platform where users can submit detailed test campaigns, track their status in real-time, and view facility information. The platform also includes a complete administrative dashboard for facility managers to view and manage all incoming client requests.

This project is built as a dynamic Single-Page Application (SPA) using vanilla JavaScript, with a secure, real-time backend powered by Google Firebase.
